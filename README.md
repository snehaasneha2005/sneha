ðŸ“š Library Book Management System
Introduction

A Library Book Management System is designed to automate the process of managing books in a library. It helps librarians track the availability of books, manage borrowing and returning of books, maintain member information, and generate reports. This system improves efficiency, reduces manual effort, and enhances user experience for both library staff and members.

How It Works (Basic Workflow)
Cataloging Books
Books are entered into the system with details like title, author, ISBN, genre, and unique ID (barcode or RFID tag).

Member Registration
Users register to become library members. Their information and membership type are stored.

Book Search & Availability
Members and librarians can search the catalog to find books and check availability.

Issue/Checkout
When a member wants to borrow a book:

The librarian scans the book barcode or RFID tag.

The system checks availability.

The book is issued, and the due date is recorded.

Return & Renewal

Upon returning, the book is scanned, and the system updates its status to available.

Members can renew books if no pending reservations exist.

Fine Calculation
If books are returned late, the system calculates fines based on the number of overdue days.

Notifications
Automated reminders for due dates or overdue books are sent via email or SMS.

Inventory & Reports
The system tracks book conditions, lost/damaged books, and generates reports on circulation, popular books, and user activity.
